\arguments{
\item{column}{an atomic vector. The variable to discretize.}

\item{name}{character. Name of the colum.}

\item{granularity}{an integer. The suggested number of levels.}

\item{mode_freq_threshold}{a real value between 0 and 1. If the mode of the
variable exceeds this value and is greater than
\code{mode_ratio_threshold} (see next parameter) times the next greatest
mode (i.e., the ratio of the value occuring most often over the value
occuring second most often is over \code{mode_ratio_threshold}) then
the variable will be attempted to be discretized in manner as to make
the mode its own bucket. (so if the mode is 5, we'd want, e.g., [2,4),
5, and (5, 7]).}

\item{mode_ratio_threshold}{a real value. See the \code{mode_freq_threshold}
parameter.}

\item{category_range}{The number of levels to consider when the
discretization procedure descrized in the \code{mode_freq_threshold}
parameter is employed. The default is \code{min(granularity, 20):20}.}

\item{lower_count_bound}{an integer. Variables with less than or equal to
this many unique values will not get discretized. Default is
\code{granularity}.}

\item{upper_count_bound}{an integer. Variables with more than or equal to
this many unique values will not get discretized. Default is
\code{granularity}.}

\item{missing_level}{character. Any values that were \code{NA} prior to
discretization will be replaced with this level. If set to \code{NULL},
then the \code{NA}s will remain. The default is \code{"Missing"}.}

\item{...}{additional arguments to pass to arules_discretize.}
